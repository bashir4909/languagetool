# Getting Azeri to work

Unfortunately language detector used does not support Azerbaijani and the library is no longer maintained. I have fork of it available here https://github.com/bashir4909/language-detector. Then we can install it as described here https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html . For me it did not work, but copying packaged JAR file into aprropriate directory in .m2 folder worked fine.
